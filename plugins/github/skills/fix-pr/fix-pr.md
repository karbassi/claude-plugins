description: Address PR review feedback by fixing issues and resolving comment threads

Address PR code review feedback systematically. Fetch both review threads (line comments) and general PR comments (issue comments), evaluate each, make fixes, and resolve/reply as appropriate.

## Process

### For review threads (line-specific comments)

1. **Mark as in-progress**
   - Add 👀 reaction to the comment to signal you're working on it
   - Use the comment's `databaseId` with the REST API

2. **Evaluate the comment**
   - Understand what's being suggested
   - Determine if the feedback is valid
   - Add 👍 reaction if you agree with the feedback
   - Add 👎 reaction if you disagree
   - If valid: proceed to step 3
   - If you disagree: Use AskUserQuestion to present options:
     - Accept the feedback anyway
     - Push back with reasoning (explain why in the reply)
     - Skip this comment for now

3. **Make the change**
   - Implement the requested fix
   - Follow the codebase's existing patterns

4. **Test the change**
   - Run relevant tests or verify the fix works
   - Ensure no regressions

5. **Commit**
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message
   - Reference the PR in the commit if appropriate

6. **Push to branch**
   - Push the changes to the PR branch

7. **Reply to the reviewer**
   - Reply to the comment thread explaining what was changed

8. **Remove the 👀 reaction**
   - Remove the eyes reaction now that you've addressed and replied

9. **Resolve the thread**
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='
   mutation($threadId: ID!) {
     resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: $threadId }) {
       thread { isResolved }
     }
   }' -f threadId='THREAD_ID'
   ```

10. **Move to next comment**

### For general PR comments (issue comments)

General PR comments cannot be "resolved" like review threads. Handle them as follows:

1. **Mark as in-progress**
   - Add 👀 reaction to the comment to signal you're working on it
   - Use the comment's database ID with the REST API

2. **Evaluate the comment**
   - Determine if it's actionable feedback, a question, or just a note
   - Add 👍 reaction if you agree with the feedback
   - Add 👎 reaction if you disagree
   - If actionable: proceed to step 3
   - If a question: answer it by replying
   - If just acknowledgment/note: no action needed

3. **Make any requested changes** (if applicable)
   - Same process as review threads: fix, test, commit, push

4. **Reply to the comment**
   - Post a new PR comment that clearly references the original (e.g., by quoting or linking it)
   - Use the REST API to create this new comment on the same pull request

5. **Remove the 👀 reaction**
   - Remove the eyes reaction now that you've addressed and replied

## Getting Started

### Determine the PR number

If not provided, get it from the current branch:
```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

### Fetch unresolved review threads

First get the owner and repo separately:
```bash
OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner -q '.owner.login')
REPO=$(gh repo view --json name -q '.name')
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number')
```

Then fetch review threads:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          isOutdated
          path
          line
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              id
              databaseId
              body
              author { login }
              createdAt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F number="$PR_NUMBER"
```

### Fetch general PR comments (issue comments)

These are comments on the PR itself, not on specific lines of code:
```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments
```

Or using GraphQL:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {
      comments(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          databaseId
          body
          author { login }
          createdAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F number="$PR_NUMBER"
```

### Add reactions to a comment

Reaction values: `eyes`, `+1`, `-1`, `laugh`, `confused`, `heart`, `hooray`, `rocket`

For review thread comments (use databaseId):
```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions -f content='eyes'
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions -f content='+1'
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions -f content='-1'
```

For general PR comments (use databaseId):
```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions -f content='eyes'
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions -f content='+1'
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions -f content='-1'
```

### Remove 👀 reaction from a comment

First, get the reaction ID:
```bash
# For review thread comments
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions

# For general PR comments
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions
```

Then delete the reaction:
```bash
gh api -X DELETE repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions/$REACTION_ID
# or for pull request review comments:
gh api -X DELETE repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/reactions/$REACTION_ID
```

### Reply to a general PR comment

GitHub issue comments don't support threading. Post a new comment that references the original:
```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments -f body='> Original comment quote

Your reply here'
```

### Reply to a review thread

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($threadId: ID!, $body: String!) {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: $threadId,
    body: $body
  }) {
    comment { id }
  }
}' -f threadId='PRRT_...' -f body='Fixed in latest commit'
```

## Guidelines

- Fetch both review threads AND general PR comments
- Process comments one at a time for clarity
- Read the relevant file before making changes
- Keep commits focused on individual feedback items
- Be respectful when disagreeing with feedback
- Skip already-resolved or outdated threads
- Report progress: "Fixed 3/5 review threads, addressed 2 PR comments, 1 skipped"

## Edge Cases

- **No feedback**: Report "No unresolved review threads or PR comments to address"
- **Outdated threads**: Skip with note "Thread is outdated (code has changed)"
- **Cannot fix**: Ask user how to proceed
- **Test failures**: Stop and report the issue before continuing
- **Bot comments**: Skip automated comments from bots (e.g., CI status, coverage reports)
- **Stale PR comments**: If a general comment has already been addressed in a later commit, note this in your reply
